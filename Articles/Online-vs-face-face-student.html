                    <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <center><div class="container-sm"><hr></div></center>

                                So here is the deal.
                                Due to Covid-19 we have to stay in our homes unless you want to get the coronavirus(in that case go to a therapy session).
                                Learning has been shifted from live face-to-face to online. Now, we have all experienced online learning.
                                We all have at least thought about the question "Is this better than school learning?".
                                This article is not supposed to be a clear cut answer. I have too small a sample size for that.
                                This article will only attempt to list out the PROS and CONS which I and my friends think apply here.
                            </p>
                            
                            <br>
                            
                            <p>
                                I am heavily biased. I am on the side of online education.
                                So,Â in orderÂ toÂ preventÂ thisÂ fromÂ beingÂ aÂ RANT, I have asked some of my friends to help me out in this quest.
                                So this article will be mix and match of all the points that we have come up with.
                                I also plan on doing a teacher's perspective on this topic (if my teachers agree to it)
                            </p>

                            <br>

                            <p>
                                So lets list out the PROS and CONS.
                                Then we will weight things accordingly.
                                So lets start with Face-to-face studying.
                            </p>

                                        <ul>Most teachers aren't good at technology.
                                            Change my mind if you can. This isn't even an exaggeration.
                                            Not at all. I have experienced this.
                                            Everyone has experienced this at least to some extent.
                                            They are also not accustomed to teaching in a live class.
                                            They naturally teach better in school.
                                        </ul>

                                    <br>

                                            There is no use denying that at home there is much less incentive to move.
                                            Just sit in your chair and study. Eat. Sleep. And repeat.
                                            I like to think of myself as productive and exercise of course comes under productivity.
                                            But in this past month I have skipped about a 7 days of exercise. I did expect better of me.
                                        </ul>

                                    <br>

                                    <li>Labs can be done</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            You can't have labs at home.
                                            Some nerd people like yours truly have that kind of ability.
                                            But that is for the extremes and there aren't that many.
                                            Labs are important for the development of certain ideas.
                                            It is better to do the double-split experiment than to see a bunch of strips of light in a diagram.</ul>
                                </ol>

                                    <li>Fees are higher - Not an issue for a number of people. But for some it is a great one</li>
                                        <ul>
                                            It is self explanatory. There are about 4 fans in each classroom in a medium charging school. There are about 4 sections of each class. And there are 12 classes excluding pre-first. Electricity costs grow. Amount of water usage. Maintenance. The school has to pay for that. Therefore fees are higher
                                        </ul>

                                            There is no use denying that at home there is much less incentive to move. You can sit there in you chair like a mastermind in a movie using your big brain. Well before exercising your brain you should probably exercise some of your muscles too. There are pretty important.

                            <p>It is certain that there aren't all the benefits. But I think that we get the gist of it. The biggest benefit of Online learning is being Asynchronous whereas the biggest benefit of offline Face-to-Face studying is socialisation. What do you value more? Learning anytime anywhere for free or socialisation. It is up to you to decide.</p>

                            <p>PS: From this we can see that plain video call classes are the worst as neither can you learn from them anytime anywhere nor can you have social interactions with your friends. If those video calls are recorded then you can make a case for them being online. I will be interested to know your opinions on this.
