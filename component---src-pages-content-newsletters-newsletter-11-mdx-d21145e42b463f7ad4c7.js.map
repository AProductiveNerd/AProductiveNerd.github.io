As you can probably observe, the look and feel of this site have changed a lot. Now, it also has search functionality built into it. Try it by scrolling till the end of the navigation bar. If you want something similar built for you, contact me!`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Reading Review`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This week I finished Book: Think Like a Monk and Book: How to Develop Self Confidence and Improve Public speaking. But... I am not going to lie I didn't enjoy reading Book: Think Like a Monk. Some parts its great but some parts are just really not in my opinion. Would I recommend reading Book: Think Like a Monk? Yes, but with a word of caution that some parts in it are not entirely scientific and should be taken with a grain of salt. Book: How to Develop Self Confidence and Improve Public speaking was a better than average read. It is definitely worth reading but it is not really an interest catcher. I didn't finish Book: The Obstacle Is the Way because I got too hung up on some good old Sherlock Homes.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`Weekly Favourites`}</h2>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Experience`}</strong>{` - Hey this is a new type! The experience which I talk about here is the experience of taking ðŸŒ²Evergreen notes. It is simply amazing. When you read through the books material and get the gist of it to take detailed and useful notes, you get a feeling of real learning and a sense of accomplishment. I had this experience while taking ðŸŒ²Evergreen and smart notes on the Book: How to take smart notes. Before I knew it, I had written several evergreen notes each of which had some sort of an idea behind it.`}</p>\n    <p><strong parentName=\"p\">{`Coffee`}</strong>{` - It is no secret that I love coffee. Previously, my horizons were limited to instant coffee but some time ago, I finally made the switch to ground coffee and I am telling you it was worth it! I have been buying all my ground coffee from `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://bluetokaicoffee.com/\"\n      }}>{`Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters`}</a>{` and my favourite so far has been the `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://bluetokaicoffee.com/collections/coffee/products/kalledeverapura-pulp-sun-dried?variant=1309351560\"\n      }}>{`Kalledeverapura Pulp Sun Dried`}</a>{`.
