I used to like it for sure but I wasn't blown away as I thought I would be. But now it actually has blown my mind. I new that you could do exports from Readwise to Roam Research, Evernote and Notion, but I didn't think that this will be so revolutionary. I thought that Readwise would just copy my highlights from my Kindle account and paste it into my Roam database. But oh boy was I wrong. And I am glad to be wrong. Let me explain how it pleasantly surprised me. Readwise, sends you your highlights from books, and articles(and now even podcasts! at least if you are on IOS). You can tag them as your favourite, or make custom tags. When you sync your highlights to Roam, it creates a page in Roam with the name of the book concatenated with '(highlights)'. In this page it copies and pastes your highlights along with their locations in the book. So if you click on the location it automatically jumps to that place in the book. Now here is the cool part. It nests your tags in side your highlights.
