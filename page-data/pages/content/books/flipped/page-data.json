Juli has two elder brothers and Bryce has an elder sister. Juli's family's resources are mostly drained by the retarded David who is the younger brother of Juli's dad. Juli and Bryce were in second grade when they first met. Bryce had just moved in and Juli fell in love with him at the first instance. She almost got a kiss but Bryce locked himself up in the toilet. But Juli was determined. She sniffed him, followed him around. This continued till 5th class when Juli got a science fair project. In it she raised some eggs and then got little chicks out of them. And then they started laying eggs. So she did what any sensible person would do, she starting selling them. At this point of the story, it is clear that even though Juli's father doesn't have many resources, he is a great father. Then there is Bryce's father. He is somewhat well off but he is neither a good father, nor a good family member. The reason for David's illness is that he was practically choked while in his mother's stomach by his umbilical cord. As it happens, Bryce was \", mdx(\"em\", {\n    parentName: \"p\"\n  }, \"almost\"), \" choked by his umbilical cord. This information is revealed to us by Bryce's grandfather. While selling eggs, Juli decides to give the eggs for free to Bryce's family. Since Bryce's father looks down upon Juli's family, he thinks that the eggs are dirty because the chicks are raised in a dirty backyard. Bryce keeps throwing away all the eggs that Juli gives him, insulting Juli, her family and her house. The only reason that Juli's lawn remains dirty because is because her family doesn't own the house, they have rented it. And they can't ask the owner to fix it because he will raise the rent. Now what does Juli do? She takes it upon to herself to fix her house up. Then Bryce's grandfather, starts helping Juli. And then Juli tells him about what Bryce did. Bryce's grandfather is somewhat disappointed and then he teaches Bryce some lessons and stuff. Then Bryce feels guilty for doing what he did. His dad does some other bad things. And then his guilt leads to sympathy and before he knows it, he loves her. But she wants NONE of him. There was also an incident of the Sycamore tree. Which was very dear to Juli and was cut down. At the end, in order to lower Juli's anger, Bryce plants a Sycamore tree in Juli's backyard(which was fixed by Juli).
